# Meeting with the Professor

For this project I should be able to put together a demonstration of the system and walk through every part of what makes a blockchain work.

 1. How the hashing algorithm works
 2. How blocks are added to the ssytem
 3. How the blockchain is validated
 4. Show that the blockchain can't be manipulated without invalidating the blockchain
